# Download-Abortion-Tweets
Motivated by the limited datasets for stance detection, we constructed a dataset by downloading texts related to the topic of abortion legalization from Twitter through Twitter academic
API2. Focusing on the recent Supreme Court decision to ban abortion in the USA, we extracted tweets originating from the USA at three distinct time stamps (TS): i) TS1 - before the court decision was leaked (106 days from 16th January 2022 to 1st May 2022), ii) TS2 - following the leak (53 days from 2nd May 2022 to 23 June 2022), and iii) TS3 - after the court decision (53 days from 24th June 2022 to 15th August 2022), by yielding 250 records from each time stamp. We determined these dates by calculating the number of days between May 2nd (the date of the leak) and June 24th (the date of the court decision). For TS1, we extended the period to twice the duration, as the volume of tweets related to the topic of abortion legalization can be relatively lower.
